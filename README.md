# DNS module for Puppet

Installs and manages an ISC BIND DNS server with basic zones, primarily for The
Foreman.

# Usage

Include the top level `dns` class to fully configure the service.

```puppet
include dns
```

A key is set up to allow dynamic DNS updates, stored in rndc.key.  This is used
by Foreman's smart proxy to add and remove records on the fly.

Zones can be created with the `dns::zone` resource:

```puppet
dns::zone { 'example.com': }
```

Keys can be created with the `dns::key` resource:

```puppet
dns::key {'dns-key':}
```

Slaves can also be configured by setting `allow_transfer` in the master's zone
and setting `zonetype => 'slave'` in the slave's zone.

Logging can be added with the `dns::logging_categories` and `dns::logging_channels` defined types.  The following Hiera example shows all the available options:

```yaml
dns::logging_categories:
  unmatched:
    channels:
      - 'test_file'
      - 'test_stderr'
      - 'test_syslog'
      - 'test_null'
dns::logging_channels:
  test_file:
    file_path: '/var/log/named/test.log'
    file_versions: 3
    file_size: '5m'
    log_type: 'file'
    print_category: 'yes'
    print_severity: 'yes'
    print_time: 'yes'
    severity: 'dynamic'
  test_null:
    log_type: 'null'
    print_category: 'yes'
    print_severity: 'yes'
    print_time: 'yes'
    severity: 'dynamic'
  test_stderr:
    log_type: 'stderr'
    print_category: 'yes'
    print_severity: 'yes'
    print_time: 'yes'
    severity: 'dynamic'
  test_syslog:
    log_type: 'syslog'
    print_category: 'yes'
    print_severity: 'yes'
    print_time: 'yes'
    severity: 'dynamic'
    syslog_facility: 'auth'
```
