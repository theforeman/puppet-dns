# DNS module for Puppet

Installs and manages an ISC BIND DNS server with basic zones, primarily for The
Foreman.

# Usage

Include the top level `dns` class to fully configure the service.

    include ::dns

A key is set up to allow dynamic DNS updates, stored in rndc.key.  This is used
by Foreman's smart proxy to add and remove records on the fly.

Zones can be created with the `dns::zone` resource:

    dns::zone { 'example.com': }

Slaves can also be configured by setting `allow_transfer` in the master's zone
and setting `zonetype => 'slave'` in the slave's zone.

# Static records

Create 'static' DNS records, such as CNAME records, using the `dns::record` type.

    dns::record { 'foo.example.com':
      target  => 'vm123.example.com.'
      type    => 'CNAME'
    }

**NOTE**: Support for static records is disabled by default, and needs to be enabled
for each zone separately. For instance: 

    dns::zone { 'example.com':
      static_records  => true,
    }
